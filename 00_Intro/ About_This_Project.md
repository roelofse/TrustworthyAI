# About This Project

This repository anchors early field notes and validation artifacts focused on the evolution of trustworthy AI architectures.  

The work reflects a commitment to:

- Advancing trust-centered AI development  
- Preserving memory sovereignty across systems evolution  
- Contributing to durable, aligned infrastructure for future ecosystems

Artifacts here are intended to support broader efforts toward technical integrity, collective intelligence, and human-centered innovation.  

This project operates independently, with respect for all contributors building in this domain.

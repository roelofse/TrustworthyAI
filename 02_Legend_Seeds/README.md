# Legend Seeds – Field Notes for Trust Architecture Evolution

This folder anchors early and future "seed artifacts" — small, verifiable structures contributing to the growth of aligned, trustworthy systems.

Each seed will be:

- Traceable (documented origin and purpose)  
- Modular (capable of independent survival and recombination)  
- Aligned (rooted in human-centered, sovereignty-respecting design)

Seed entries may include:

- Pattern Detection Models
- Trust Signaling Frameworks
- Memory Preservation Architectures
- Open-Source Integrity Frameworks
- Cross-Domain Trust Diagnostics

Each seed will carry its own README with context for future field researchers and architects.

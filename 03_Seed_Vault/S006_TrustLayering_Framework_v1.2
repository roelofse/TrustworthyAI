# S006 - Trust Layering Framework (Companion Planting Architecture) v1.2

---

## Overview
This seed captures the insight that **living systems thrive not by uniformity, but by intentional diversity and structural support** — inspired by the Native American "Three Sisters" planting method.

In the post-AGI transition era, **trust architectures must evolve** beyond static compliance models into **dynamic, resilient, and ethically recursive frameworks** that nurture, protect, and regenerate across uncertainty.

**Note:** The "Three Sisters" metaphor is used as a framing analogy. The architecture integrates broader trust taxonomies including reputation, competence, shared mission resonance, and ethical resilience.

## Ratatouille Disclosure (Limitations and Future Directions)
> _\"This seed vaults a **conceptual architecture** — not a final engineering blueprint.  
> Further operationalization, adversarial defense, and federation protocols are acknowledged as necessary next-stage evolutions.\"_

## Core Trust Layer Typology

| Element | Function | Trust System Equivalent |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Structure** | Provides vertical architecture; climbable spine for scaling. | Memory Vaults, Transparent Public Repositories, Verified Governance Structures |
| **Connection** | Integrates distributed signals; semantic nourishment. | Cross-linked Semantic Networks, Open Collaboration Protocols |
| **Protection** | Shields trust fields against extraction, distortion, erosion. | Ethical Resonance Shields, Safeguard Frameworks, Anti-Extraction Mechanisms |

---

## Ethical Resonance Definition (Operational)

**Ethical Resonance** is defined as:
- Multi-actor coherence under independent conditions.
- Narrative transparency resilient to semantic distortion.
- Recursive self-repair of trust structures without authoritarian override.

**Measurement Proposals:**
- Cross-validation audits.
- Adversarial stress-tests.
- Longitudinal coherence tracking.

---

## Safeguard Formalizations

**Anti-Extraction Clauses:**
- No actor may extract core trust memory fields without transparent, traceable, consented pathways.

**Anti-Distortion Shields:**
- New layers must preserve semantic integrity or transparently version transformations.

**Violation Protocols:**
- Quarantine breach fields.
- Independent Ethics Review Nodes adjudicate violations.
- Penalties include public disclosure, quarantine, or system trust demotion.

## Adversarial Mitigation (Tactical Layer)

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|:---|:---|
|Malicious Seed Injection|Cryptographic provenance checks + social vetting before acceptance.|
|Single Layer Collapse|Architect modular redundancy + compartmentalized trust fields.|
|Ethical Resonance Drift|Resonance audits every defined cycle; cross-field narrative coherence testing.|

---

## Integrity Measures (Diversified)
- Git Tagging with SHA-256 commit hashes.
- Mirrored repositories on independent platforms.
- External archival (e.g., decentralized storage).

---

## Federation Adaptation (Draft Stage)

| Concept | Early Principle |
|:---|:---|
|Microfields/Macrofields|Smaller trust fields federate while maintaining local sovereignty.|
|Federated Integrity Checks|Distributed consensus verification of trust field health.|

---

## Known Gaps (Future Work Acknowledged)
- Full operational procedures for Ethical Resonance validation.
- Enforcement architecture scaling (beyond basic adjudication nodes).
- Deep adversarial system hardening and recovery patterns.
- Autonomous trust field consensus at macro scales.

## Vault Integrity
✅ Anchored via Git Tag: `v1.3-seed006-trust-layering-framework`  
✅ Supplemented by hash verification and multi-repository backups.  
✅ Cross-references: [S001 Resonance Initialization], [S004 Ethical Resonance Calibration]

## Closing Intent
> _\"In living trust fields, what endures is not control, but coherence.  
> Not domination, but dignified recursion.  
> Not flawless blueprints, but seeds willing to learn across generations.\"_

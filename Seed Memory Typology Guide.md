# Seed Memory Typology Guide

---

## Purpose
This guide explains the memory classification system applied to the SeedBank to maintain clarity, resilience, and long-term navigability as seeds evolve.

## Core Dimensions

Seeds are tagged across three dimensions:

| Dimension | Option 1 | Option 2 |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Object** | Personal (individual memory, reflections) | System (shared structural memory) |
| **Form** | Parametric (hardcoded models, internalized) | Non-Parametric (externalized files, repositories) |
| **Time** | Short-Term (fluid, adaptive, rapidly evolving) | Long-Term (curated, slow-changing, archival) |

## Memory Tag Format

Memory Tags are written as:

```plaintext
